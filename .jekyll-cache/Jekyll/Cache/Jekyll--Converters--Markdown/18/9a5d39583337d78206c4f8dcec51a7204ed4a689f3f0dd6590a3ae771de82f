I"ì<p>C++. The language which stikes fear into the very heart of CS students. In the age of Python and JavaScript it is mearly a fable told to scare us surely? Pointers. Segmentation faults. Manually installing libraries. The stories canâ€™t be true - <strong>can they?</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been looking into getting my head around C++ - the idea of speed and power have always sounded very exciting and other languages just werenâ€™t doing it for me. Compiling to a binary also means when you want to share your new exciting project with a friend you just need to send them a single zip file, rather than an instruction list of which Python packages to install for example.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t be covering how to install SFML here, as there are hundreds of ways to do it per system <em>and hundreds of people who will say Iâ€™m showing you the wrong way anyway.</em></p>

<p>So, to get started in my game development process I wanted a simple starting point - the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello World!</code> equivalent in game development <a href="https://www.ponggame.org/pong-no-flash.php">Pong</a> is a classic arcade game with a painfully simple concept: hit the ball. Since my future goals would involve a complicated project I wanted to get the basics down first; this included player controls, rendering, and networking.</p>

<p>I decided to make a simple â€˜starterâ€™ template which I could then bolster for future use.</p>
