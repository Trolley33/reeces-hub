I"w<p>My name is Reece, I’m a software development student who enjoys programming in his spare time. This website is where I document my thoughts and showcase any projects I think are worth showing off, you can also visit my <a href="https://github.com/Trolley33?tab=repositories">Github</a> for any projects I don’t feel are worthy of a full write up. Enjoy your stay!</p>
