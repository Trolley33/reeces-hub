Last time we worked on getting a simple SFML window to popup, a completely blank canvas for us to begin our work on - _perfect_.

### Displaying the Paddles
Our players will be represented by rectangular paddles, which move up and down the screen. Luckily SFML has just the class to help us here, `sf::RectangleShape`.

We'll extend our `Application.hpp` to have a member variable for each player:
```c++
/** Application.hpp **/
private:
  sf::RenderWindow window;

  float frameDelta;

  Player player1;
  Player player2;
```

And default their position/colours/size in the `App` constructor.

```c++
/** Application.cpp **/
App::App(int width, int height, sf::String title)
{
  // Create render window.
  window.create(sf::VideoMode(width, height), title);
  window.setFramerateLimit(30);

  // Create Players
  player1.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(10, 10));  // create at top left
  player2.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(100, 40)); // create at top right

  player1.setSize(sf::Vector2f(20, 60));
  player2.setSize(sf::Vector2f(20, 60));

  player1.setFillColor(sf::Color::White);
  player2.setFillColor(sf::Color::White);
  /** ... **/
}
```
Now we just need to tell the application to render/draw the paddles each frame:
```c++ 
/** Application.cpp **/
void App::render()
{
  window.clear();

  window.draw(player1);
  window.draw(player2);

  window.display();
}
```

Oh yeah, now we're cooking with gas! 
Although - staring at the blank, unmoving paddles is a little... _bland_. Let's get them moving.

### User Input
Remember when we defined our `processInputs()` function? Let's go ahead and implement that.

Starting with a simple example:
```c++
/** Application.cpp **/
void App::processInput()
{
  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Down))
  {
    player1.move(0, 1);
  }
}
```

Nice! But here's an issue, if the user's computer is running too slow or too fast - the pong paddle will do the same.

<sup style="color: #777">Here the framerate is set to 320 rather than 30 for emphasis.</sup>

We can't just increase or decrease the speed, because the function is called once per frame... How about we scale the distance based on the amount of time since the previous frame!

We already have stored the number of seconds since the previous frame in our member variable `frameDelta`, let's use it here:
```c++
/** Application.cpp **/
void App::processInput()
{
  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Down))
  {
    player1.move(0, frameDelta * 100);
  }
}
```

Now that we're all synced up, let's add a few more buttons.
```c++
void App::processInput()
{
  const int pixelsPerSeconds = 150;
  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::S))
  {
    player1.move(0, frameDelta * pixelsPerSeconds);
  }
  else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::W))
  {
    player1.move(0, frameDelta * -pixelsPerSeconds);
  }

  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Down))
  {
    player2.move(0, frameDelta * pixelsPerSeconds);
  }
  else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Up))
  {
    player2.move(0, frameDelta * -pixelsPerSeconds);
  }
}
```

Things sure are starting to come together! Next time we will look into adding the ball, and some collision detection.
