Collisions, love 'em, hate 'em - we all gotta deal with them. I often wish I could phase through my arm through the fridge to get myself a snack but life is cruel sometimes.

### Ball Setup
So last time we set up a nice little starter template for Pong - a pair of paddles we can control with the keyboard. There's still a missing element though - the ball.

Since typically balls are circular in nature, we'll go ahead and define the ball using an `sf::CircleShape`. However, unlike the players which only really need position; the ball will need to store it's velocity as well. 

To do this we'll create a simple `struct` which stores this as well as the `CircleShape`:

```c++
/** Application.hpp **/
struct Ball
{
  sf::CircleShape circleShape;
  sf::Vector2f vel;
}

// class App {...
  sf::RectangleShape player1;
  sf::RectangleShape player2;

  Ball ball;
// etc ...
```
<sup style="color: #777">Note: by defining the struct in our header file it is actually usable in our `cpp` file as well, so we don't need to redeclare it - nice!.</sup>

Next we need to give the ball some initial conditions in our `App` constructor:

```c++
App::App(int width, int height, sf::String title)
{
  // Create render window.

  // Create Players

  // Create ball
  ball.circleShape = sf::CircleShape(15.0f); // initial radius
  ball.circleShape.setFillColor(sf::Color::White);
  ball.circleShape.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(width / 2, height / 2));
  ball.vel = sf::Vector2f(1, 0);

  // boring stuff ...
}
```

Let's quickly add it to our render functions as well to draw it to the screen.

```c++
void App::render()
{
  window.clear();

  window.draw(player1);
  window.draw(player2);

  window.draw(ball.circleShape);

  window.display();
}
```

Well it looks like a ball! Notice however that even though we told the ball to set its position to half the width & half the height - it isn't centered. This is because by default our ball will render starting in the top left, rather than it's center. We can correct this by adding the following line of code when the `CircleShape` is created:
```c++
//ball.circleShape.setFillColor(sf::Color::White);
  ball.circleShape.setOrigin(sf::Vector2f(-ball.circleShape.getRadius(), -ball.circleShape.getRadius()));
//ball.circleShape.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(width / 2, height / 2));
```

This offsets the rendering of the circle by half of it's size (radius is half of diameter).

Next up we need to update the position of the ball every frame according to it's velocity - here I want to make a change, rather than updating the location of the paddles within the `processInput()` function, I think I'd prefer to move all 3 objects within the same function, and simply use a struct like we have here to hold the vertical velocity of the Player's.

### Time for Some Cheeky ùì°ùìÆùìØùì™ùì¨ùìΩùì∏ùìªùì≤ùì∑ùì∞
I won't show the whole file for each change, here's a condensed version:

### Movement Function
So now that that's out of the way, let's change our `processInputs()` function like so:

```c++
void App::processInput()
{
  const int pixelsPerSeconds = 150;

  player1.verticalVel = 0;
  player2.verticalVel = 0;

  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::S))
  {
    player1.verticalVel = pixelsPerSeconds;
  }
  else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::W))
  {
    player1.verticalVel = -pixelsPerSeconds;
  }

  if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Down))
  {
    player2.verticalVel = pixelsPerSeconds;
  }
  else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Up))
  {
    player2.verticalVel = -pixelsPerSeconds;
  }
}
```

Then we can create ourselves a new function to do all the movements:
```c++
void App::doMovements()
{
  player1.rectShape.move(0, frameDelta * player1.verticalVel);
  player2.rectShape.move(0, frameDelta * player2.verticalVel);
}
```

We'll also re-arrange our mainloop to do the movements before rendering.

```c++
/** App::App() { ... */
  while (window.isOpen())
  {
    frameDelta = clock.restart().asSeconds();

    processEvents();
    processInput();
    doMovements();

    render();
  }
/** ...
}
*/
```

Now we have everything back to normal we implement the basic ball movement code.
```c++
void App::doMovements()
{
  player1.rectShape.move(0, frameDelta * player1.verticalVel);
  player2.rectShape.move(0, frameDelta * player2.verticalVel);

  ball.circleShape.move(ball.vel);
}
```

I'm going to quickly implement a helper function to rotate a vector by some degrees, this will make it a lot easier to do rotations later.

```c++
void rotateVec(sf::Vector2f& vec, double angle)
{
  double x2 = (vec.x * std::cos(angle * PI / 180.0)) 
            - (vec.y * std::sin(angle * PI / 180.0));

  double y2 = (vec.x * std::sin(angle * PI / 180.0)) 
            + (vec.y * std::cos(angle * PI / 180.0));

  vec.x = x2;
  vec.y = y2;
}
```

<sup style="color: #777;">Function above comes from [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) wikipedia article on rotation of vectors - we're using `PI / 180` to convert from Radians to Degrees, read more about that [here](https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-guide-to-angles-degrees-and-radians/).</sup>


Now we can use the function to make our ball bounce off the edges (we could have just inverted the horizontal velocity but as an example):

```c++
void App::doMovements()
{
  // other movements ...
  if (ball.circleShape.getPosition().x <= 0 || ball.circleShape.getPosition().x >= window.getSize().x)
  {
    rotateVec(ball.vel, 180.0);
  }
}
```
