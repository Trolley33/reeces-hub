C++. The language which stikes fear into the very heart of CS students. In the age of Python and JavaScript it is mearly a fable told to scare us surely? Pointers. Segmentation faults. Manually installing libraries. The stories can't be true - **can they?**

Over the past few weeks I've been looking into getting my head around C++ - the idea of speed and power have always sounded very exciting and other languages just weren't doing it for me. Compiling to a binary also means when you want to share your new exciting project with a friend you just need to send them a single zip file, rather than an instruction list of which Python packages to install for example.

One of the most popular C++ game engines/libaries is **S**imple **F**ast **M**edia **L**ibrary (**SFML**) - I won't be covering how to install SFML here, as there are hundreds of ways to do it per system _and hundreds of people who will say I'm showing you the wrong way anyway._

So, to get started in my game development process I wanted a simple starting point - the `Hello World!` equivalent in game development. [Pong](https://www.ponggame.org/pong-no-flash.php). The classic arcade game with a painfully simple concept, hit the ball. Since my future goals would involve a more complicated project I wanted to get the basics down first; this included opening a SFML window, taking input from the player, and rendering objects to screen.

I decided to make a simple 'starter' template which I could then bolster for future use.

With C++ a very useful practice is the use of header files. These are descriptions of what a class/function will do when used, but not how it will do it. It allows you to abstract the structure of the class without worring about the smaller picture.

Here's how I wanted to lay it out:
1. Poll for window events (closing).
2. Read user input => convert into movement.
3. Render to screen.

I created my `Application.hpp` file as below:
```c++
#ifndef __APPLICATION_H__
#define __APPLICATION_H__

#include "SFML/Graphics.hpp"
#include "SFML/Main.hpp"
#include "SFML/System.hpp"

class App
{
private:
  sf::RenderWindow window;

  float frameDelta;

public:
  App(int width, int height, sf::String title);

  void processEvents();
  void processInput();
  void render();
};

#endif // __APPLICATION_H__

```
<sup style="color: #777">Don't worry about the `#ifndef __APPLICATION_H__` weirdness, it just prevents this file being included more than once by mistake. We're also not going to be putting the network functions in until later, as they are more nuanced and deserve a full write up (plus I'm not sure what I'm going to call them yet ;))</sup>

Here you can see a basic constructor which will take the width, height, and title of the game app; a render function; and 2 processing functions for events and inputs.

I expanded the constructor to initialise and launch the SFML window like so:
```c++
App::App(int width, int height, sf::String title)
{
  // Create render window.
  window.create(sf::VideoMode(width, height), title);
  window.setFramerateLimit(30);

   // Init timer variables.
  frameDelta = 0;

  sf::Clock clock;

  while (window.isOpen())
  {
    processEvents();
    processInput();

    frameDelta = clock.restart().asSeconds();
    render();
  }
}
```

We have to implement the `processEvents()` function to prevent the window from hanging as the close button is an event:
```c++
void App::processEvents()
{
  sf::Event e;
  while (window.pollEvent(e))
  {
    if (e.type == sf::Event::Closed)
    {
      window.close();
    }
  }
}
```

We'll also clear the window and display it in the render function:
```c++
void App::render()
{
  window.clear();

  window.display();
}
```

With a few example paramaters this gives us the following result:

Sucess! We have opened a SFML window. 

Up next we will get into rendering shapes/sprites, and handling user inputs.
