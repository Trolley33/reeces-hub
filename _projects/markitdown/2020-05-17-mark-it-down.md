### About
This project is actually quite dear to me in terms of my experience in web development (despite not being a web app). 

On my first introduction to Vue.js I was creating all custom components and importing bootstrap on every one to try and get them to work properly; then I discovered [Bootstrap-Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/), a npm package that has the Bootstrap components converted to Vue components ready to use with your data model - perfect!

<sup style="color: #777">I looked also at [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) which works on a very similar concept but for material design</sup>

However, as I used the framework more and more I felt more and more limited by the in-built styles, and everything started to look too... _Bootstrappy?_

I decided I wanted to start using custom styles on my sites, but in my experience I'm more of a functionality kind of guy over UI/UX design so I had no idea where to get started. 

[TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com/).

After a slightly rough setup (what even are CSS pre/post processors?) I fell in love with this framework. It gives you the tools to do everything how you want to do it: 
- One-off styling? Apply as many classes as you want from their array of styles.
- Re-usable components? Slap them in a class with the `@apply` directives.

Using TailWind was the first time _I_ felt like I was doing the designing, and honestly I'm really happy with how the app looks.

Have a suggestion/bug?
