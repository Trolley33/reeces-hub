### About
This app was developed for my "Mobile Application Development" module at University. Overall the app functions pretty well and I learned a lot about the inner workings of Android phones and just how difficult it is to get an app to work on _every_ device.

Unfortunately as soon as I handed in this coursework <sup><sub>(91%)</sub></sup> I lost interest in the development, and although my lecturer said he thought it might do well on the App store I didn't want to go through all the rigmarole of getting approval and ongoing development. Plus I shortly after factory reset my PC and I really didn't fancy installing Android Studio again just to re-compile the apk.

### Downloads?
- Sorry, I don't have time to actually release this app on the app store unforunately! Since I changed PC I haven't actually even recompiled the source code. My bad.
